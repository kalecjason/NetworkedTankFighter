The game is a multiplayer tank shooting game, where the objective is to defeat the opposing player tank.
While avoiding the invincible zombie tank which guard the powerups in each corner of the map.
These zombie tanks will rotate to face the nearest player and then shoot a tank round at the player damaging the player if it hits.
The powerup when picked up will give the player an infinite fire rate, removing the reload timer, these powerups flash white and red, and are in each corner of the map

The tank uses W to move forwards and S to move backwards.
A is used to rotate the tank counter-clockwise and D is used to rotate the tank clockwise
finally to shoot a tank round you press the spacebar.

If a tank round is fired at the wall of the maze it will destroy a section of the maze and reveal a small column where the player can see through, 
and eventually navigate through if the hole becomes large enough.

Each player can take a total of three hits from tank rounds before being destroyed, players can be damaged either from other players or from zombie tanks.
and once a player is able to fire a round their tank will become slightly red to signify that they are able to shoot

When the two players connect one will spawn in the top right and one player will spawn in the bottom right of the map.

Thus the object of the game is to destroy the enemy player while avoiding the enemy zombie tanks. by making use of the various tools at the players disposal
such as the powerups in each corner of the map which increase the players fire rate, players can destroy parts of walls to outsmart their enemy.
